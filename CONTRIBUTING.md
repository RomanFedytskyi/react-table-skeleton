Thank you for wanting to contribute to react-table-skeleton! A few quick rules to keep contributions smooth:

- **File an issue first** for non-trivial changes or feature requests so we can discuss scope.
- **Fork + PR workflow**: fork the repo, create a feature branch, make changes, run the typechecker (`npm run typecheck`) and build (`npm run build`) locally, and open a PR against `main`.
- **Small, focused PRs**: prefer small changes that are easy to review.
- **Commit messages**: keep them concise and descriptive. Use present-tense verbs.
- **Tests & typecheck**: include a minimal test/demo or type updates when changing types.
- **Style**: follow existing code style. Don’t reformat unrelated files.

Maintainers will review PRs and request changes as needed. Thanks!
